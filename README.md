# Build in debug mode
swift build

# Build in release mode
swift build -c release

# Or use Makefile
make build
```

### Testing

```

### Project Structure

```

â”œâ”€â”€ Package.swift              # Swift package configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ Sources/focusctl/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.swift            # Command-line interface
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ FocusManager.swift    # Core focus mode management

## How it Works

FocusCTL is a native Swift application that interfaces with macOS Focus system through:

1. **NSUserDefaults Integration**: Stores focus mode states in user preferences
2. **Notification System**: Posts system notifications to update focus states
3. **Shortcuts Framework**: Creates Shortcuts app actions for automation
4. **Command-Line Interface**: Provides intuitive terminal commands

No SIP disable required, no extra daemonsâ€”just clean, efficient integration with the macOS Focus system.

## Requirements

- macOS 12.0 or later
- Xcode 13.0 or later (for building from source)
- Swift 5.5 or later

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Issues

If you encounter permission errors during installation:

```bash
# Ensure /usr/local/bin exists and is writable
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
sudo chown $(whoami) /usr/local/bin
```

### Command Not Found

If `focusctl` command is not found after installation:

```bash
# Check if it's installed
ls -la /usr/local/bin/focusctl

# Add to PATH if needed
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Shortcuts Actions Not Working

If Shortcuts actions don't appear:

```bash
# Reinstall Shortcuts actions
focusctl shortcuts uninstall
focusctl shortcuts install

# Check Shortcuts directory
ls -la ~/Library/Shortcuts/
```
